## Purpose

This is a marketing website for an imaginary coffee company that roasts and distributes Yemeni coffee. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential customers. The aim for the website’s owner is to showcase and sell different kinds of Yemeni coffee directly to the consumer, and also educate the customer about the history and role of Yemen in the coffee industry. This could potentially raise awareness to how the revival of this industry would lead to an economic recovery in the country.


## User Experience (UX)

    -	As a Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the company.
    -	I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
    -	I want to be able to find information about the products.
    -   I want to be able to buy the products.
    -   I want to learn more about the relation of Yemen to the coffee industry.
    -   I want to see pictures that tell more to the story and purpose of the website.
    -   I want to be able to contact the organization for any questions I may have.
    -   I want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
    -   I want to sign up to the Newsletter, so I am emailed any updates/ discounts about the products.

-   ### Design  
    -   #### Color Scheme:
        -   The main colors used are the Yemeni flag’s colors, red, white, and black. The header’s hero image has the 3 colors, with the dominant red background. The body’s background is white while the footers background is black with white text and red buttons.

    -   #### Typography
        -   The Exo and Ubuntu fonts are the main fonts used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn’t being imported into the site correctly. These fonts are clean making them attractive and appropriate.

    -   #### Imagery
        -   Hero-Image: To catch the user’s attention, a delicious looking white cup of black coffee is presented on a red background. Red is an energizing color that represents the friendliness of the people of Yemen and the strength of their coffee. The minimal looking image intensifies your craving for a cup of coffee.
        - 	Gallery / Slideshow: Pictures that demonstrate the beauty of different parts of the country and its coffee production.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   As a Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organization.
    
    1.  Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a “Shop” Call to action button. The Text’s font size and the way it is presented on different devices has been styled accordingly for better readability.
    2.  The main points are made immediately with the hero image and text provided.
    3.  The navigation bar has the “About” link that scrolls the user down to the About section for more information about the company and what they’re trying to achieve. Under “Our Mission” section the company’s ethos is described.

-   I want to be able to easily navigate through the site to find content.

    1.  The users have three options:

        1.  Click the call to action button that takes them directly to the Shop page.
        2.  Click on the navigation bar items that takes them to their section of choice. On smaller devices clicking on the burger icon drops down the hidden navigation items. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page/section they will end up at clearly. At the bottom clicking on the logo icon scrolls the users smoothly back to the top of the page, alongside with the social media icons to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn’t feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
        3.  Scroll down to explore the different website’s sections.

    2.  I want to be able to find information about the products.

        1.  Upon scrolling down, the first thing the user sees is what a Coffee researcher had to say about the Yemeni coffee.
        2.  In the same section the products names are displayed with a brief and pleasing description that makes the user want to know more. Hight quality images of the different types of Coffee beans are also presented next to the description. Products are presented Horizontally on bigger screens and Vertically on smaller devices.
        3.  A “More” call to action button redirects the user to the Shop page for more information about the products.
        4.  In the Shop page, 4 high quality images for each product and its packaging are presented in a slideshow window with a next and previous button to freely browser the images.
        5.  More information is shown about the products, such as the price, availability, and the flavor profile. Also, in this section the Products are presented Horizontally on bigger screens and Vertically on smaller devices.
    
    3.  I want to be able to buy the products.

        1.  In the Shop page, and as the website has been created only using HTML5 and CSS3, the user won’t be able to buy the product just yet as that requires JavaScript coding and backend technologies. So, the products have been listed with red-bold text to grab the user’s attention immediately as “Out of Stock” for the moment and the price stroke out. But instead a “Sign Up” call to action button asks the user to sign up to be informed once the product becomes available for purchase.
        2.  Upon clicking the “Sign-Up” button, a Sign-Up form emerges as a small pop-up screen window with a “Thank you for signing up” message and the required information fields to be filled out and also a submit button.

            1.  The pop-up window is responsive on different devices and appears with a slightly transparent background. Also, it is styled to appear around the middle of the screen.
            2.  By trying to submit and empty form, missing field or invalid email address, an error message is verified to appear.
            3.  By submitting the form with valid inputs, the page reloads as the form is not linked to any database.
    
    4.  I want to learn more about the relation of Yemen to the coffee industry.

        1.  As part of the About section, content of few paragraphs copied from an article is placed under “History” that gives the user better understanding on why the company has chosen to feature the Yemeni coffee.
        2.  Link to the original article is proposed under the content if the user wanted to learn more. This link opens in a new Tab window so that the user’s experience won’t be interrupted.

    5.  I want to see pictures that tell more to the story and purpose of the website.

        1.  Under the About section, a small collection of photos from the country and it’s coffee production are displayed in a full width slideshow that runs automatically with a next and previous button to freely browser the images.
        2.  The height of the slideshow is set to be equal to that of the header background, to maintain the aesthetic feel and balance throughout the website.
        3.  KNOWN ISSUE: the choice of the images doesn’t represent the idea intended from this section. The lack of resources to a better and a wider verity of images from the country was the reason, as all the images used were copyright free images.

    6.  I want to be able to contact the organization for any questions I may have.

        1.  The navigation bar clearly highlights the “Contact Us” form.
        2.  Upon clicking the “Contact Us” link, a Contact Us form emerges as a pop-up screen window with a “We’d like to hear from you” message and the required information fields to be filled out and also a submit button.

            1.  The pop-up window is responsive on different devices and appears with a slightly transparent background. Also, it is styled to appear around the middle of the screen.
            2.  By trying to submit and empty form, missing field or invalid email address, an error message is verified to appear.
            3.  By submitting the form with valid inputs, the page reloads as the form is not linked to any database.

    7.  I want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

        1.  The user can scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        2.  Upon clicking on the preferred social media icon, the user is redirected to the login page of that social media platform as the company is only imaginary. This link opens in a new Tab window, so it won’t interrupt the user’s experience.

    8.  I want to sign up to the Newsletter, so I am emailed any updates/ discounts about the products.

        1.  At the bottom of every page there is a footer which content is consistent throughout all pages.
        2.  In the middle of the footer the user can see “The Latest” and is prompted to Enter their email address.
        3.  There is a red “Subscribe” button to the right-hand side of the input field that can easily be distinguished.

            1.  This button appears centered and underneath the input field on smaller devices.
            2.  By trying to submit an empty or invalid email address, an error message is verified to appear.
            3.  By submitting the form with valid input, the page reloads as the form is not linked to any database.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox and Opera browsers.
-   The Website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Samsung Galaxy A51, OnePlus 7.
-   The Google Chrome browsers built-in DevTool was used to view and style the website on iPad Pro, iPad, iPhone X, iPhone 6/7/8 and the plus versions, and iPhone 5/SE
-   Testing was done to ensure that pages link correctly, and that the layout of the content appeared in the most pleasing and clean-looking manner.
-   Friends & Mentor were asked to review the site to point out any bugs and/or UX issues.

### Fixed bugs

-   Mozilla Firefox browser had a problem with displaying the slideshow of the product images in the Shop page. Once every new image scrolls into place, the container would stretch out and stretch back in. The problem was in the class used for that container.
-   The logo in the footer was disoriented. Resized the image and fixed its alignment to % instead of pixels.
-   Sign up and contact form was too high up on the screen when using a mobile device. Added a top margin of 15% for better reach and usability.
-   When the website is viewed using a mobile device with the screen being held horizontally, the Text and Motto of main page were overlapping the hero image, although they have been styled to appear to the right side of the cup on different screen sizes viewed vertically. I outlined the text with a 0.02 shadow to make it readable and stand out. Also did the same for the brand name for the overall better look of the page.
-   The Subscribe button looked disoriented on the iPhone 5. Styled it according to that specific resolution.
